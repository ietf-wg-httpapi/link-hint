1.  Introduction

   HTTP [HTTP] clients can discover a variety of information about a
   resource by interacting with it.  For example, the methods supported
   by a resource can be learned by examining the Allow header field in
   responses from it, and the need for authentication is conveyed with a
   401 (Authentication Required) status code.

   Often, it can be beneficial to know this information before
   interacting with the resource; not only can such knowledge save time
   (through reduced round trips), but it can also influence the choices
   made by the code or user driving the interaction.  For example, a
   user interface that presents the data from an HTTP-based API might
   need to know which resources the user has write access to, so that it
   can present the appropriate interface.

   This specification defines a vocabulary of HTTP link hints that allow
   such metadata about HTTP resources to be attached to Web links
   [WEB-LINKING], thereby making it available before the link is
   followed.  It also establishes a registry for future hints.

   Hints are just that -- they are not a contract, and are to only be
   taken as advisory.  The runtime behaviour of the resource always
   overrides hinted information.  For example, a client might receive a
   hint that the PUT method is allowed on all "widget" resources.  This
   means that generally, the client can send a PUT to them, but a
   specific resource might reject a PUT based upon access control or
   other considerations.

   More fine-grained information might also be gathered by interacting
   with the resource (e.g., via a GET), or by another resource
   containing it (such as a widgets collection) or describing it (e.g.,
   one linked to it with a "describedby" link relation).

   There is not a single way to convey hints with a link; rather, it is
   expected that this will be done by individual link serialisations
   (see Section 3.4.1 of [WEB-LINKING]).

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  HTTP Link Hints

   A HTTP link hint is a (key, value) tuple that describes the target
   resource of a Web link [WEB-LINKING], or describes the link itself.
   The value's canonical form is expressed in subset of the data types
   defined by HTTP Structured Fields [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

   Typically, link hints are serialised in links as target attributes
   (Section 3.4.1 of [WEB-LINKING]).  In the Link HTTP Header, this can
   be done by serialising those attributes as strings.  In other link
   formats, this requires a mapping from the canonical data model into
   the constraints of that format.

   The information in a link hint SHOULD NOT be considered valid for
   longer than the freshness lifetime (Section 4.2 of [HTTP-CACHING]) of
   the representation that the link occurred within, and in some cases,
   it might be valid for a considerably shorter period.

   Likewise, the information in a link hint is specific to the link it
   is attached to.  This means that if a representation is specific to a
   particular user, the hints on links in that representation are also
   specific to that user.

3.  Pre-Defined HTTP Link Hints

3.1.  allow

   *  Hint Name: allow

   *  Description: Hints the HTTP methods that can be used to interact
      with the target resource; equivalent to the Allow HTTP response
      header.

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, containing HTTP methods
   (Section 9 of [HTTP]).

3.2.  formats

   *  Hint Name: formats

   *  Description: Hints the representation type(s) that the target
      resource can produce and consume, using the GET and PUT (if
      allowed) methods respectively.

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, containing media types
   (Section 8.3.1 of [HTTP]).

3.3.  accept-post

   *  Hint Name: accept-post

   *  Description: Hints the POST request format(s) that the target
      resource can consume.

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, with the same constraints as
   for "formats".

   When this hint is present, "POST" SHOULD be listed in the "allow"
   hint when present.

3.4.  accept-patch

   *  Hint Name: accept-patch

   *  Description: Hints the PATCH [RFC5789] request format(s) that the
      target resource can consume; equivalent to the Accept-Patch HTTP
      response header.

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, containing media types
   (Section 8.3.1 of [HTTP]) that identify the acceptable patch formats.

   When this hint is present, "PATCH" SHOULD be listed in the "allow"
   hint when present.

3.5.  accept-ranges

   *  Hint Name: accept-ranges

   *  Description: Hints the range-specifier(s) available for the target
      resource; equivalent to the Accept-Ranges HTTP response header
      [HTTP].

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, containing HTTP ranges-
   specifiers (Section 14.1.1 of [HTTP]).

3.6.  accept-prefer

   *  Hint Name: accept-prefer

   *  Description: Hints the preference(s) [RFC7240] that the target
      resource understands (and might act upon) in requests.

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, containing preferences
   (Section 2 of [RFC7240]).  Note that, by its nature, a preference can
   be ignored by the server.

3.7.  precondition-req

   *  Hint Name: precondition-req

   *  Description: Hints that the target resource requires state-
      changing requests (e.g., PUT, PATCH) to include a precondition, as
      per Section 13.1 of [HTTP], to avoid conflicts due to concurrent
      updates.

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, with possible values "etag"
   and "last-modified" indicating type of precondition expected.

   See also the 428 Precondition Required status code ([RFC6585]).

3.8.  auth-schemes

   *  Hint Name: auth-schemes

   *  Description: Hints that the target resource requires
      authentication using the HTTP Authentication framework Section 11
      of [HTTP].

   *  Content Model: Inner List of Strings

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Inner List of Strings, each corresponding to a HTTP
   authentication scheme (Section 11.1 of [HTTP]), and optionally a
   "realms" member containing an array of zero to many strings that
   identify protection spaces that the resource is a member of.

3.9.  auth-realms

   *  Hint Name: auth-realms

   *  Description: Hints the authentication realm(s) available for those
      schemes that support them in the HTTP Authentication framework
      Section 11 of [HTTP].

   *  Content Model: array (of strings)

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an array of strings, each indicating a protection
   space that the resource is a member of.

3.10.  status

   *  Hint Name: status

   *  Description: Hints the status of the target resource.

   *  Content Model: Token

   *  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a Token; possible values are:

   *  deprecated - indicates that use of the resource is not
      recommended, but it is still available.

   *  gone - indicates that the resource is no longer available; i.e.,
      it will return a 410 (Gone) HTTP status code if accessed.

4.  Security Considerations

   Clients need to exercise care when using hints.  For example, a naive
   client might send credentials to a server that uses the auth-req
   hint, without checking to see if those credentials are appropriate
   for that server.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  HTTP Link Hint Registry

   This specification defines the HTTP Link Hint Registry.  See
   Section 2 for a general description of the function of link hints.

   Link hints are generic; that is, they are potentially applicable to
   any HTTP resource, not specific to one application of HTTP, nor to
   one particular format.  Generally, they ought to be information that
   would otherwise be discoverable by interacting with the resource.

   Hint names MUST be composed of the lowercase letters (a-z), digits
   (0-9), underscores ("_") and hyphens ("-"), and MUST begin with a
   lowercase letter.

   Hint content MUST be described using valid combinations of the
   following types defined by HTTP Structured Fields
   ([STRUCTURED-FIELDS]):

   *  Inner List (Section 3.1.2 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS])

   *  Item (Section 3.3 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS])

   Hint semantics SHOULD be described in terms of the framework defined
   in [WEB-LINKING].

   New hints are registered using the Expert Review process described in
   [RFC8126] to enforce the criteria above.  Requests for registration
   of new resource hints are to use the following template:

   *  Hint Name: [hint name]

   *  Description: [a short description of the hint's semantics]

   *  Content Model: [allowed Structured Fields types]

   *  Specification: [reference to specification document]

   Initial registrations are enumerated in Section 3.  The "rel", "rev",
   "hreflang", "media", "title", and "type" hint names are reserved, so
   as to avoid potential clashes with link serialisations.
